<h1>Our Sunday Supplication</h1>

<h2>Sunday, November 15, 2020</h2>
<h3>Thirty-Third Sunday in Ordinary Time</h3>

<p>Holy Mass is at the very core of our worship as a Catholic community. Nothing can ever be substituted for the celebration of the Eucharist. But in this exceptional time of difficulty for our communities, our nation, and the whole world, this order of prayer can be offered by individuals and families and engages us in our Sunday celebration of the Word of God. We can pray this prayer in our homes—the “domestic churches” which help build up the Body of Christ on earth—and thus be connected to the entire Church at prayer.</p>

<p>During this time of prayer, we include the opportunity to make a Spiritual Communion. Making a Spiritual Communion is a worthy practice, recommended by innumerable saints throughout the ages, which unites our whole selves to God and his Church.</p>

<h2>Order of Prayer</h2>
<p><b><i>Taken from the Mass and the Liturgy of the Hours</i></b></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><b>Leader:</b> God, ✠ come to my assistance.<br>
<b>Response:</b> Lord, make haste to help me.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
<b>Response:</b> as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.</p>

<h3>Hymn</h3>
<p>God, whose giving knows no ending,<br>
From your rich and endless store:<br>
Nature’s wonder, Jesus’ wisdom,<br>
Costly cross, grave’s shattered door,<br>
Gifted by you, we turn to you,<br>
Off’ring up ourselves in praise;<br>
Thankful song shall rise forever,<br>
Gracious donor of our days.</p>

<p>Skills and time are ours for pressing<br>
Toward the goals of Christ, your Son:<br>
All at peace in health and freedom,<br>
Races joined, the Church made one.<br>
Now direct our daily labor,<br>
Lest we strive for self alone;<br>
Born with talents, make us servants<br>
Fit to answer at your throne.</p>

<p>Treasure, too, you have entrusted,
Gain through pow’rs your grace conferred;
Ours to use for home and kindred,
And to spread the gospel word.
Open wide our hands in sharing,
As we heed Christ’s ageless call,
Healing, teaching, and reclaiming,
Serving you by loving all.</p>

<h3>Act of Contrition</h3>
<p><b>Leader:</b> Let us acknowledge our sins, and seek the Lord’s pardon and peace.<br>
<br>
<b>Together:</b> I confess to almighty God<br>
and to you, my brothers and sisters,<br>
that I have greatly sinned,<br>
in my thoughts and in my words,<br>
in what I have done and in what I have failed to do,<br>
through my fault, through my fault,<br>
through my most grievous fault;<br>
therefore I ask blessed Mary ever-Virgin,<br>
all the Angels and Saints,<br>
and you, my brothers and sisters,<br>
to pray for me to the Lord our God.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b> Grant us, we pray, O Lord our God,<br>
the constant gladness of being devoted to you,<br>
for it is full and lasting happiness to serve with constancy<br>
the author of all that is good.<br>
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,<br>
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,<br>
one God, for ever and ever.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Amen.</p>

<h2>The Sunday Readings</h2>
<h3>A reading from the Book of Proverbs (Proverbs 31:10–13, 19–20, 30–31)</h3>
<p>When one finds a worthy wife, her value is far beyond pearls.  Her husband, entrusting his heart to her, has an unfailing prize.  She brings him good, and not evil, all the days of her life.  She obtains wool and flax and works with loving hands.  She puts her hands to the distaff, and her fingers ply the spindle.  She reaches out her hands to the poor, and extends her arms to the needy.  Charm is deceptive and beauty fleeting; the woman who fears the LORD is to be praised.  Give her a reward for her labors, and let her works praise her at the city gates.</p>
<p><b>The Word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>Responsorial Psalm (Psalms 128:1–2, 3, 4–5)</h3>
<p><b>Reader:</b> Blessed are those who fear the Lord.<br>
<b>Together:</b>	Blessed are those who fear the Lord.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> Blessed are you who fear the LORD,<br>
who walk in his ways!<br>
For you shall eat the fruit of your handiwork;<br>
blessed shall you be, and favored.<br>
<b>Together:</b>	Blessed are those who fear the Lord.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> Your wife shall be like a fruitful vine<br>
in the recesses of your home;<br>
Your children like olive plants<br>
around your table.<br>
<b>Together:</b>	Blessed are those who fear the Lord.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> Behold, thus is the man blessed<br>
who fears the LORD.<br>
The LORD bless you from Zion:<br>
may you see the prosperity of Jerusalem<br>
all the days of your life.<br>
<b>Together:</b>  Blessed are those who fear the Lord.</p>

<h3>A Reading from the first Letter of Saint Paul to the Thessalonians        (1 Thessalonians 5:1-6)</h3>
<p>Concerning times and seasons, brothers and sisters, you have no need for anything to be written to you.  For you yourselves know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief at night.  When people are saying, "Peace and security," then sudden disaster comes upon them, like labor pains upon a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.</p>

<p>But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness, for that day to overtake you like a thief.  For all of you are children of the light and children of the day.  We are not of the night or of darkness.  Therefore, let us not sleep as the rest do, but let us stay alert and sober.</p>
<p><b>The word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>Gospel Verse  (John 15:4A, 5B)</h3>
<p><b>Reader:</b> Remain in me as I remain in you, says the Lord.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Whoever remains in me bears much fruit.</p>

<h3>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Matthew (Matthew 25:14-30)</h3>
<p>Jesus told his disciples this parable: "A man going on a journey called in his servants and entrusted his possessions to them.  To one he gave five talents; to another, two; to a third, one – to each according to his ability.  Then he went away.  Immediately the one who received five talents went and traded with them, and made another five.  Likewise, the one who received two made another two.  But
the man who received one went off and dug a hole in the ground and buried his master's money.</p>

<p>"After a long time the master of those servants came back and settled accounts with them.  The one who had received five talents came forward bringing the additional five.
He said, 'Master, you gave me five talents.  See, I have made five more.’  His master said to him, 'Well done, my good and faithful servant.  Since you were faithful in small matters, I will give you great responsibilities.  Come, share your master's joy.’  Then the one who had received two talents also came forward and said, 'Master, you gave me two talents.  See, I have made two more.' His master said to him, 'Well done, my good and faithful servant.  Since you were faithful in small matters, I will give you great responsibilities.  Come, share your master's joy.’  Then the one who had received the one talent came forward and said, 'Master, I knew you were a demanding person, harvesting where you did not plant and gathering where you did not scatter; so out of fear I went off and buried your talent in the ground.  Here it is back.'  His master said to him in reply, 'You wicked, lazy servant!  So you knew that I harvest where I did not plant and gather where I did not scatter?  Should you not then have put my money in the bank so that I could have got it back with interest on my return?  Now then! Take the talent from him and give it to the one with ten.  For to everyone who has, more will be given and he will grow rich; but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away.  And throw this useless servant into the darkness outside,
where there will be wailing and grinding of teeth.'"</p>

<p><b>The Gospel of the Lord.</b><br>
―Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ</p>

<h3>For Reflection:</h3>
<ol>
<li>What common thread ties the First Reading together with the Gospel?</li>
<li>St. Paul writes a very challenging, and perhaps frightening message, in our Second Reading.  What response does this passage evoke in you?   How might you live more in accord with the advice that St. Paul gives?</li>
<li>What has God invested in you?  How are you putting this investment to good use for the glory of God?</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Leader:</b> Let us pray together as Jesus taught us:<br>

<b>Response:</b> Containing in itself all delight<br>

<b>Together:</b> My Jesus,<br>
I believe that you are present<br>
in the Most Holy Sacrament of the Altar.<br>
I love you above all things,<br>
and I desire to receive you into my soul.<br>
Since I cannot at this moment receive you sacramentally,<br>
come at least spiritually into my heart.<br>
I embrace you as if you were already there<br>
and unite myself wholly to you.<br>
Never permit me to be separated from you,<br>
my Lord and my God!<br>
Amen.</p>

<h2>Canticle of Praise</h2>
<p><b>Canticle of Zechariah (Luke 1:68-79)</b><br>

<b>Together:</b> ✠ Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel;<br>
he has come to his people and set them free.<br>
He has raised up for us a mighty savior,<br>
born of the house of his servant David.<br>
Through his holy prophets he promised of old<br>
that he would save us from our enemies,<br>
from the hands of all who hate us.<br>
He promised to show mercy to our fathers<br>
and to remember his holy covenant.<br>
This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham:<br>
to set us free from the hands of our enemies,<br>
free to worship him without fear,<br>
holy and righteous in his sight<br>
all the days of our life.<br>
You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High;<br>
for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way,<br>
to give his people knowledge of salvation<br>
by the forgiveness of their sins.<br>
In the tender compassion of our God<br>
the dawn from on high shall break upon us,<br>
to shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death,<br>
and to guide our feet into the way of peace.<br>
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,<br>
and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,<br>
world without end. Amen.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><b>Leader:</b> ✠ May the Lord bless us, protect us from all evil,
and bring us to everlasting life.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Amen.</p>
