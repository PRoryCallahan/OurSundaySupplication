<h1>Our Sunday Supplication</h1>

<h2>Sunday, December 6, 2020</h2>
<h3>Second Sunday of Advent</h3>

<p>Holy Mass is at the very core of our worship as a Catholic community. Nothing can ever be substituted for the celebration of the Eucharist. But in this exceptional time of difficulty for our communities, our nation, and the whole world, this order of prayer can be offered by individuals and families and engages us in our Sunday celebration of the Word of God. We can pray this prayer in our homes—the “domestic churches” which help build up the Body of Christ on earth—and thus be connected to the entire Church at prayer.</p>

<p>During this time of prayer, we include the opportunity to make a Spiritual Communion. Making a Spiritual Communion is a worthy practice, recommended by innumerable saints throughout the ages, which unites our whole selves to God and his Church.</p>

<h2>Order of Prayer</h2>
<p><b><i>Taken from the Mass and the Liturgy of the Hours</i></b></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><b>Leader:</b> God, ✠ come to my assistance.<br>
<b>Response:</b> Lord, make haste to help me.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
<b>Response:</b> as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.</p>

<h3>Hymn</h3>
<p>On Jordan’s bank the Baptist’s cry<br>
Announces that the Lord is nigh;<br>
Awake and hearken, for he brings<br>
Glad tidings of the King of kings.</p>

<p>Then cleansed be ev’ry life from sin;<br>
Make straight the way for God within,<br>
And let each heart prepare a home<br>
Where such a mighty guest may come.</p>

<p>To heal the sick stretch out your hand,<br>
And bid the fallen sinner stand;<br>
Shine forth and let your light restore<br>
Earth’s own true loveliness once more.</p>

<p>All praise to you, eternal Son,<br>
Whose advent has our freedom won,<br>
Whom with the Father we adore,<br>
And Holy Spirit, evermore.</p>

<h3>Act of Contrition</h3>
<p><b>Leader:</b> Let us acknowledge our sins, and seek the Lord’s pardon and peace.<br>
<br>
<b>Together:</b> I confess to almighty God<br>
and to you, my brothers and sisters,<br>
that I have greatly sinned,<br>
in my thoughts and in my words,<br>
in what I have done and in what I have failed to do,<br>
through my fault, through my fault,<br>
through my most grievous fault;<br>
therefore I ask blessed Mary ever-Virgin,<br>
all the Angels and Saints,<br>
and you, my brothers and sisters,<br>
to pray for me to the Lord our God.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b> Almighty and merciful God,<br>
may no earthly undertaking hinder those<br>
who set out in haste to meet your Son,<br>
but may our learning of heavenly wisdom<br>
gain us admittance to his company.<br>
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,<br>
one God, for ever and ever.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Amen.</p>

<h2>The Sunday Readings</h2>
<h3>A reading from the Book of the Prophet Isaiah  (Isaiah 40:1–5, 9–11)</h3>
<p>Comfort, give comfort to my people, says your God.  Speak tenderly to Jerusalem, and proclaim to her that her service is at an end, her guilt is expiated; indeed, she has received from the hand of the LORD double for all her sins.</p>
<p>A voice cries out: In the desert prepare the way of the LORD!  Make straight in the  wasteland a highway for our God!  Every valley shall be filled in, every mountain and hill shall be made low; the rugged land shall be made a plain, the rough country, a broad valley.  Then the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all people shall see it together;
for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.</p>
<p>Go up on to a high mountain, Zion, herald of glad tidings; cry out at the top of your voice, Jerusalem, herald of good news! Fear not to cry out and say to the cities of Judah:
Here is your God!  Here comes with power the Lord GOD, who rules by his strong arm;
here is his reward with him, his recompense before him.  Like a shepherd he feeds his flock; in his arms he gathers the lambs, carrying them in his bosom, and leading the ewes with care.</p>

<p><b>The Word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>Responsorial Psalm (Psalms 85:9–10, 11–12, 13–14)</h3>
<p><b>Reader:</b> Lord, let us see your kindness, and grant us your salvation.<br>
<b>Together:</b>	Lord, let us see your kindness, and grant us your salvation.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> I will hear what God proclaims;<br>
the LORD—for he proclaims peace to his people.<br>
Near indeed is his salvation to those who fear him,<br>
glory dwelling in our land.<br>
<b>Together:</b>	Lord, let us see your kindness, and grant us your salvation.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> Kindness and truth shall meet;<br>
justice and peace shall kiss.<br>
Truth shall spring out of the earth,<br>
and justice shall look down from heaven.<br>
<b>Together:</b>	Lord, let us see your kindness, and grant us your salvation.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> The LORD himself will give his benefits;<br>
our land shall yield its increase.<br>
Justice shall walk before him,<br>
and prepare the way of his steps.<br>
<b>Together:</b>  Lord, let us see your kindness, and grant us your salvation.</p>

<h3>A Reading from the second Letter of Saint Peter    (2 Peter 3:8–14)</h3>
<p>Do not ignore this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years
and a thousand years like one day.  The Lord does not delay his promise, as some regard “delay,” but he is patient with you, not wishing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance.  But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, and then the heavens will pass away with a mighty roar and the elements will be dissolved by fire,
and the earth and everything done on it will be found out.</p>
<p>Since everything is to be dissolved in this way, what sort of persons ought you to be,
conducting yourselves in holiness and devotion, waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be dissolved in flames and the elements melted by fire.  But according to his promise we await new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells. Therefore, beloved, since you await these things,
be eager to be found without spot or blemish before him, at peace.</p>

<p><b>The word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>Gospel Verse  (Luke 3:4, 6)</h3>
<p><b>Reader:</b> Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight his paths:<br>
<b>Together:</b> All flesh shall see the salvation of God.</p>

<h3>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Mark  (Mark 1:1–8)</h3>
<p>The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ the Son of God.</p>
<p>As it is written in Isaiah the prophet: Behold, I am sending my messenger ahead of you;
he will prepare your way.  A voice of one crying out in the desert: “Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight his paths.”  John the Baptist appeared in the desert proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.  People of the whole Judean  countryside and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem were going out to him and were being baptized by him in the Jordan River as they acknowledged their sins.  John was clothed in camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist.  He fed on locusts and wild honey.
And this is what he proclaimed: “One mightier than I is coming after me.  I am not worthy to stoop and loosen the thongs of his sandals.  I have baptized you with water;
he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”</p>

<p><b>The Gospel of the Lord.</b><br>
―Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ</p>

<h3>For Reflection:</h3>
<ol>
<li>In the opening prayer today we ask, “may no earthly undertaking hinder those who set out in haste to meet your Son, but may our learning of heavenly wisdom gain us admittance to his company.”  What connections do you see between this prayer and the readings today?</li>
<li>St. Peter exhorts us in the Second Reading, “Therefore, beloved, since you await these things, be eager to be found without spot or blemish before him, at peace.”  How does the reminder of what is promised to us help us to live in peace, even amidst trials and uncertainty?</li>
<li>The word Advent means “coming” or “arrival.”  Throughout this liturgical season, we prepare for the arrival of the Lord as he came to us in flesh at Christmas, as he comes to us each day in spirit, and as he will return one day in glory.  How are you preparing during this season?  How will your preparation impact your life even after Christmas?</li>
</ol>

Since I cannot at this moment receive you sacramentally,<br>
come at least spiritually into my heart.<br>
I embrace you as if you were already there<br>
and unite myself wholly to you.<br>
Never permit me to be separated from you,<br>
my Lord and my God!<br>
Amen.</p>

<h2>Canticle of Praise</h2>
<p><b>Canticle of Zechariah (Luke 1:68-79)</b><br>

<b>Together:</b> ✠ Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel;<br>
he has come to his people and set them free.<br>
He has raised up for us a mighty savior,<br>
born of the house of his servant David.<br>
Through his holy prophets he promised of old<br>
that he would save us from our enemies,<br>
from the hands of all who hate us.<br>
He promised to show mercy to our fathers<br>
and to remember his holy covenant.<br>
This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham:<br>
to set us free from the hands of our enemies,<br>
free to worship him without fear,<br>
holy and righteous in his sight<br>
all the days of our life.<br>
You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High;<br>
for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way,<br>
to give his people knowledge of salvation<br>
by the forgiveness of their sins.<br>
In the tender compassion of our God<br>
the dawn from on high shall break upon us,<br>
to shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death,<br>
and to guide our feet into the way of peace.<br>
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,<br>
and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,<br>
world without end. Amen.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><b>Leader:</b> ✠ May the Lord bless us, protect us from all evil,
and bring us to everlasting life.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Amen.</p>
