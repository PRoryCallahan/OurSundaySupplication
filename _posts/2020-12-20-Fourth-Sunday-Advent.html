<h1>Our Sunday Supplication</h1>

<h2>Sunday, December 20, 2020</h2>
<h3>Fourth Sunday of Advent</h3>

<p>Holy Mass is at the very core of our worship as a Catholic community. Nothing can ever be substituted for the celebration of the Eucharist. But in this exceptional time of difficulty for our communities, our nation, and the whole world, this order of prayer can be offered by individuals and families and engages us in our Sunday celebration of the Word of God. We can pray this prayer in our homes—the “domestic churches” which help build up the Body of Christ on earth—and thus be connected to the entire Church at prayer.</p>

<p>During this time of prayer, we include the opportunity to make a Spiritual Communion. Making a Spiritual Communion is a worthy practice, recommended by innumerable saints throughout the ages, which unites our whole selves to God and his Church.</p>

<h2>Order of Prayer</h2>
<p><b><i>Taken from the Mass and the Liturgy of the Hours</i></b></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><b>Leader:</b> God, ✠ come to my assistance.<br>
<b>Response:</b> Lord, make haste to help me.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
<b>Response:</b> as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.</p>

<h3>Hymn</h3>
<p><b>V.</b>	O Come, O come, Emmanuel,<br>
	And ransom captive Israel,<br>
	That mourns in lonely exile here<br>
	Until the Son of God appear. <b>R.</b></p>

<p><b>R.</b> 	Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel<br>
	Shall come to you, O Israel.</p>

<p><b>V.</b> O Come, O Key of David, come,<br>
	And open wide our heav’nly home;<br>
	Make safe the way that leads on high,<br>
	And close the path to misery. <b>R.</b> </p>

<p><b>V.</b> 	O Come, O Dayspring from on high,<br>
	And cheer us by your drawing nigh;<br>
	Disperse the gloomy clouds of night,<br>
	And death’s dark shadow put to flight. <b>R.</b>

<p><b>V.</b> 	O come, Desire of nations, bind<br>
	In one the hearts of humankind;<br>
	O bid our sad divisions cease,<br>
	And be for us our King of Peace. <b>R.</b>

<h3>Act of Contrition</h3>
<p><b>Leader:</b> Let us acknowledge our sins, and seek the Lord’s pardon and peace.<br>
<br>
<b>Together:</b> I confess to almighty God<br>
and to you, my brothers and sisters,<br>
that I have greatly sinned,<br>
in my thoughts and in my words,<br>
in what I have done and in what I have failed to do,<br>
through my fault, through my fault,<br>
through my most grievous fault;<br>
therefore I ask blessed Mary ever-Virgin,<br>
all the Angels and Saints,<br>
and you, my brothers and sisters,<br>
to pray for me to the Lord our God.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b> Pour forth, we beseech you, O Lord,<br>
	your grace into our hearts<br>
	that we, to whom the Incarnation of Christ your Son<br>
	was made known by the message of an Angel,<br>
  may by his Passion and Cross<br>
  be brought to the glory of his Resurrection.<br>
	Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,<br>
  one God, for ever and ever.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Amen.</p>

<h2>The Sunday Readings</h2>
<h3>A reading from the second Book of Samuel   	      (2 Samuel 7:1–5, 8b–12, 14a, 16)</h3>
<p>When King David was settled in his palace, and the LORD had given him rest from his enemies on every side, he said to Nathan the prophet, “Here I am living in a house of cedar, while the ark of God dwells in a tent!”  Nathan answered the king, “Go, do whatever you have in mind, for the LORD is with you.”  But that night the LORD spoke to Nathan and said: “Go, tell my servant David, ‘Thus says the LORD:
Should you build me a house to dwell in?’"</p>
<p>"'It was I who took you from the pasture and from the care of the flock to be commander of my people Israel.  I have been with you wherever you went, and I have destroyed all your enemies before you.  And I will make you famous like the great ones of the earth.
I will fix a place for my people Israel; I will plant them so that they may dwell in their place without further disturbance.  Neither shall the wicked continue to afflict them as they did of old, since the time I first appointed judges over my people Israel.  I will give you rest from all your enemies.  The LORD also reveals to you that he will establish a house for you.  And when your time comes and you rest with your ancestors, I will raise up your heir after you, sprung from your loins, and I will make his kingdom firm.  I will be a father to him, and he shall be a son to me.
Your house and your kingdom shall endure forever before me; your throne shall stand firm forever.'”</p>

<p><b>The Word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>Responsorial Psalm (Psalm 89:2–3, 4–5, 27, 29)</h3>
<p><b>Reader:</b> For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.<br>
<b>Together:</b>	For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b>The promises of the LORD I will sing forever;<br>
through all generations my mouth shall proclaim your faithfulness.<br>
For you have said, “My kindness is established forever;"<br>
in heaven you have confirmed your faithfulness.<br>
<b>Together:</b>	For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> “I have made a covenant with my chosen one,<br>
I have sworn to David my servant:<br>
Forever will I confirm your posterity<br>
and establish your throne for all generations.”<br>
<b>Together:</b>	For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> “He shall say of me, ‘You are my father,<br>
my God, the Rock, my savior.’<br>
Forever I will maintain my kindness toward him,<br>
and my covenant with him stands firm.”<br>
<b>Together:</b>  For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.</p>

<h3>A Reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Romans        (Romans 16:25–27)</h3>
<p>Brothers and sisters: To him who can strengthen you, according to my gospel and the proclamation of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery kept secret for long ages but now manifested through the prophetic writings and, according to the command of the eternal God, made known to all nations to bring about the obedience of faith,
to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ be glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p><b>The word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>Gospel Verse  (Luke 1:38)</h3>
<p><b>Reader:</b> Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord.<br>
<b>Together:</b> May it be done to me according to your word.</p>

<h3>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Luke  		      (Luke 1:26–38)</h3>
<p>The angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town of Galilee called Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man named Joseph, of the house of David, and the virgin’s name was Mary.  And coming to her, he said, “Hail, full of grace! The Lord is with you.”  But she was greatly troubled at what was said and pondered what sort of greeting this might be.
Then the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.</p>
<p>“Behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall name him Jesus.
He will be great and will be called Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of David his father, and he will rule over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.”  But Mary said to the angel, “How can this be, since I have no relations with a man?”  And the angel said to her in reply, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you.  Therefore the child to be born will be called holy, the Son of God.  And behold, Elizabeth, your relative, has also conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month for her who was called barren; for nothing will be impossible for God.”  Mary said, “Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord.  May it be done to me according to your word.”
Then the angel departed from her.</p>

―Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ</p>
