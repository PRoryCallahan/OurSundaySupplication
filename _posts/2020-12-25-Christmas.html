<h1>Our Sunday Supplication</h1>

<h2>Friday, December 25, 2020</h2>
<h3>The Solemnity of the Nativity of the Lord</h3>

<p>Holy Mass is at the very core of our worship as a Catholic community. Nothing can ever be substituted for the celebration of the Eucharist. But in this exceptional time of difficulty for our communities, our nation, and the whole world, this order of prayer can be offered by individuals and families and engages us in our Sunday celebration of the Word of God. We can pray this prayer in our homes—the “domestic churches” which help build up the Body of Christ on earth—and thus be connected to the entire Church at prayer.</p>

<p>During this time of prayer, we include the opportunity to make a Spiritual Communion. Making a Spiritual Communion is a worthy practice, recommended by innumerable saints throughout the ages, which unites our whole selves to God and his Church.</p>

<h2>Order of Prayer</h2>
<p><b><i>Taken from the Mass and the Liturgy of the Hours</i></b></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><b>Leader:</b> God, ✠ come to my assistance.<br>
<b>Response:</b> Lord, make haste to help me.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
<b>Response:</b> as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.</p>

<h3>Hymn</h3>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/mEq7i8w2w4g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Audio Recording</a></p>
<p>Joy to the world, the Lord is come!<br>
Let earth receive her king;<br>
Let ev’ry heart prepare him room<br>
And heav’n and nature sing,<br>
And heav’n and nature sing,<br>
And heav’n, and heav’n and nature sing.</p>

<p>Joy to the earth, the Savior reigns!<br>
Let us our songs employ;<br>
While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains,<br>
Repeat the sounding joy,<br>
Repeat the sounding joy,<br>
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.</p>

<p>He rules the world with truth and grace,<br>
And makes the nations prove<br>
The glories of his righteousness,<br>
And wonders of his love,<br>
And wonders of his love,<br>
And wonders, wonders of his love.</p>

<h3>Act of Contrition</h3>
<p><b>Leader:</b> Let us acknowledge our sins, and seek the Lord’s pardon and peace.<br>
<br>
<b>Together:</b> I confess to almighty God<br>
and to you, my brothers and sisters,<br>
that I have greatly sinned,<br>
in my thoughts and in my words,<br>
in what I have done and in what I have failed to do,<br>
through my fault, through my fault,<br>
through my most grievous fault;<br>
therefore I ask blessed Mary ever-Virgin,<br>
all the Angels and Saints,<br>
and you, my brothers and sisters,<br>
to pray for me to the Lord our God.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b> O God, who wonderfully created the dignity of human nature<br>
	and still more wonderfully restored it,<br>
	grant, we pray,<br>
	that we may share in the divinity of Christ,<br>
	who humbled himself to share in our humanity.<br>
	Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,<br>
	one God, for ever and ever.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Amen.</p>

<h3>A reading from the Book of the Prophet Isaiah   	            		 (Isaiah 52:7–10) </h3>
<p>How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him who brings glad tidings, announcing peace, bearing good news, announcing salvation, and saying to Zion,
“Your God is King!”</p>

<p>Hark!  Your sentinels raise a cry, together they shout for joy, for they see directly, before their eyes, the LORD restoring Zion.  Break out together in song, O ruins of Jerusalem!
For the LORD comforts his people, he redeems Jerusalem.  The LORD has bared his holy arm in the sight of all the nations;
all the ends of the earth will behold the salvation of our God.</p>

<p><b>The Word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>Responsorial Psalm (Psalm 98:1, 2–3, 3–4, 5–6)</h3>
<p><b>Reader:</b> All the ends of the earth have seen the saving power of God.<br>
<b>Together:</b> All the ends of the earth have seen the saving power of God.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> Sing to the LORD a new song,<br>
for he has done wondrous deeds;<br>
his right hand has won victory for him,<br>
his holy arm.<br>
<b>Together:</b> All the ends of the earth have seen the saving power of God.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> The LORD has made his salvation known:<br>
in the sight of the nations he has revealed his justice.<br>
He has remembered his kindness and his faithfulness<br>
toward the house of Israel.<br>
<b>Together:</b> All the ends of the earth have seen the saving power of God.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> All the ends of the earth have seen<br>
the salvation by our God.<br>
Sing joyfully to the LORD, all you lands;<br>
break into song; sing praise.<br>
<b>Together:</b> All the ends of the earth have seen the saving power of God.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> Sing praise to the LORD with the harp,<br>
with the harp and melodious song.<br>
With trumpets and the sound of the horn<br>
sing joyfully before the King, the LORD.<br>
<b>Together:</b> All the ends of the earth have seen the saving power of God.</p>

<h3>A Reading from the Letter to the Hebrews			       (Hebrews 1:1–6)</h3>
<p>Brothers and sisters: In times past, God spoke in partial and various ways to our ancestors through the prophets; in these last days, he has spoken to us through the Son, whom he made heir of all things and through whom he created the universe, who is the refulgence of his glory, the very imprint of his being, and who sustains all things by his mighty word.
When he had accomplished purification from sins, he took his seat at the right hand of the Majesty on high,
as far superior to the angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs.</p>

<p>For to which of the angels did God ever say: You are my son; this day I have begotten you?
Or again: I will be a father to him, and he shall be a son to me? And again, when he leads the firstborn into the world, he says:
Let all the angels of God worship him.</p>

<p><b>The word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>A reading from the holy Gospel according to John  		          (John 1:1–18)</h3>
<p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
He was in the beginning with God.  All things came to be through him, and without him nothing came to be.  What came to be through him was life, and this life was the light of the human race; the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.
A man named John was sent from God.  He came for testimony, to testify to the light,
so that all might believe through him.  He was not the light, but came to testify to the light.
The true light, which enlightens everyone, was coming into the world.  He was in the world, and the world came to be through him, but the world did not know him.  He came to what was his own,
but his own people did not accept him.</p>

<p>But to those who did accept him he gave power to become children of God, to those who believe in his name, who were born not by natural generation nor by human choice nor by a man’s decision but of God.  And the Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us, and we saw his glory, the glory as of the Father’s only Son, full of grace and truth.
John testified to him and cried out, saying, “This was he of whom I said, ‘The one who is coming after me ranks ahead of me because he existed before me.’”  From his fullness we have all received, grace in place of grace, because while the law was given through Moses,
grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.  No one has ever seen God.  The only Son, God, who is at the Father’s side, has revealed him.</p>

<p><b>The Gospel of the Lord.</b><br>
―Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ</p>

<h3>For Reflection:</h3>
<ol>
<li>We begin our prayer today with this beautiful prayer from the Mass:<br>
<br>
"O God, who wonderfully created the dignity of human nature<br>
and still more wonderfully restored it,<br>
grant, we pray,<br>
that we may share in the divinity of Christ,<br>
who humbled himself to share in our humanity."<br>
<br>
How does this prayer help us to understand better what we celebrate today?</li>
<li>Our Gospel today is one of the most beautiful, but also most mysterious, passages in the New Testament.  What word or phrase from the Gospel catches your attention or resonates in your heart?
What might God be saying to you through it?</li>

my Lord and my God!<br>

<h2>Canticle of Praise</h2>
<p><b>Canticle of Zechariah (Luke 1:68-79)</b><br>

<b>Together:</b> ✠ Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel;<br>
he has come to his people and set them free.<br>
He has raised up for us a mighty savior,<br>
born of the house of his servant David.<br>
Through his holy prophets he promised of old<br>
that he would save us from our enemies,<br>
from the hands of all who hate us.<br>
He promised to show mercy to our fathers<br>
and to remember his holy covenant.<br>
This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham:<br>
to set us free from the hands of our enemies,<br>
free to worship him without fear,<br>
holy and righteous in his sight<br>
all the days of our life.<br>
You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High;<br>
for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way,<br>
to give his people knowledge of salvation<br>
by the forgiveness of their sins.<br>
In the tender compassion of our God<br>
the dawn from on high shall break upon us,<br>
to shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death,<br>
and to guide our feet into the way of peace.<br>
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,<br>
and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,<br>
world without end. Amen.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

and bring us to everlasting life.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Amen.</p>
