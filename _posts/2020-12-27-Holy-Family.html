<h1>Our Sunday Supplication</h1>

<h2>Sunday, December 27, 2020</h2>
<h3>Feast of the Holy Family</h3>

<p>Holy Mass is at the very core of our worship as a Catholic community. Nothing can ever be substituted for the celebration of the Eucharist. But in this exceptional time of difficulty for our communities, our nation, and the whole world, this order of prayer can be offered by individuals and families and engages us in our Sunday celebration of the Word of God. We can pray this prayer in our homes—the “domestic churches” which help build up the Body of Christ on earth—and thus be connected to the entire Church at prayer.</p>

<p>During this time of prayer, we include the opportunity to make a Spiritual Communion. Making a Spiritual Communion is a worthy practice, recommended by innumerable saints throughout the ages, which unites our whole selves to God and his Church.</p>

<h2>Order of Prayer</h2>
<p><b><i>Taken from the Mass and the Liturgy of the Hours</i></b></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><b>Leader:</b> God, ✠ come to my assistance.<br>
<b>Response:</b> Lord, make haste to help me.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
<b>Response:</b> as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.</p>

<h3>Hymn</h3>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/ZkgEifezv2Q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Audio Recording</a></p>
<p><b>V.</b> Angels we have heard on high<br>
	Sweetly singing o’er the plains,<br>
	And the mountains in reply<br>
	Echo back their joyous strains.</p>

<p><b>V.</b> Shepherds, why this jubilee?<br>
	Why your joyous strains prolong?<br>
	Say what may the tidings be<br>
	Which inspire your heav’nly song. <b>R.</b></p>

<p><b>R.</b> Glória in excélsis Deo.<br>
	Glória in excélsis Deo.</p>

<p><b>V.</b> Come to Bethlehem and see<br>
	Him whose birth the angels sing;<br>
	Come, adore on bended knee<br>
	Christ, the Lord, the newborn King.</p>

<p><b>V.</b> See him in a manger laid<br>
	Whom the angels praise above;<br>
	Mary, Joseph, lend your aid,<br>
	While we raise our hearts in love. <b>R.</b></p>

<h3>Act of Contrition</h3>
<p><b>Leader:</b> Let us acknowledge our sins, and seek the Lord’s pardon and peace.<br>
<br>
<b>Together:</b> I confess to almighty God<br>
and to you, my brothers and sisters,<br>
that I have greatly sinned,<br>
in my thoughts and in my words,<br>
in what I have done and in what I have failed to do,<br>
through my fault, through my fault,<br>
through my most grievous fault;<br>
therefore I ask blessed Mary ever-Virgin,<br>
all the Angels and Saints,<br>
and you, my brothers and sisters,<br>
to pray for me to the Lord our God.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b> O God, who were pleased to give us<br>
the shining example of the Holy Family,<br>
graciously grant that we may imitate them<br>
in practicing the virtues of family life<br>
and in the bonds of charity,<br>
and so, in the joy of your house,<br>
delight one day in eternal rewards.<br>
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,<br>
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,<br>
one God, for ever and ever.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Amen.</p>

<h2>The Sunday Readings</h2>

<h3>A reading from the Book of Genesis      	                 (Genesis 15:1–6; 21:1–3)</h3>
<p>The word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision, saying: “Fear not, Abram!  I am your shield; I will make your reward very great.”  But Abram said, “O Lord GOD, what good will your gifts be, if I keep on being childless and have as my heir the steward of my house, Eliezer?”  Abram continued, “See, you have given me no offspring, and so one of my servants will be my heir.”  Then the word of the LORD came to him: “No, that one shall not be your heir; your own issue shall be your heir.”  The Lord took Abram outside and said, “Look up at the sky and count the stars, if you can.  Just so,” he added, “shall your descendants be.”
Abram put his faith in the LORD, who credited it to him as an act of righteousness.</p>

<p>The LORD took note of Sarah as he had said he would; he did for her as he had promised.
Sarah became pregnant and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time that God had stated.
Abraham gave the name Isaac to this son of his whom Sarah bore him.</p>

<p><b>The Word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>Responsorial Psalm (Psalm 105:1–2, 3–4, 5–6, 8–9)</h3>
<p><b>Reader:</b> The Lord remembers his covenant for ever.<br>
<b>Together:</b> The Lord remembers his covenant for ever.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> Give thanks to the LORD, invoke his name;<br>
make known among the nations his deeds.<br>
Sing to him, sing his praise,<br>
proclaim all his wondrous deeds.<br>
<b>Together:</b> The Lord remembers his covenant for ever.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> Glory in his holy name;<br>
rejoice, O hearts that seek the LORD!<br>
Look to the LORD in his strength;<br>
constantly seek his face.<br>
<b>Together:</b> The Lord remembers his covenant for ever.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> You descendants of Abraham, his servants,<br>
sons of Jacob, his chosen ones!<br>
He, the LORD, is our God;<br>
throughout the earth his judgments prevail.<br>
<b>Together:</b> The Lord remembers his covenant for ever.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> He remembers forever his covenant<br>
which he made binding for a thousand generations<br>
which he entered into with Abraham<br>
and by his oath to Isaac.<br>
<b>Together:</b> The Lord remembers his covenant for ever.</p>

<h3>A Reading from the Letter to the Hebrews			   (Hebrews 11:8, 11–12, 17–19)</h3>
<p>Brothers and sisters: By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place
that he was to receive as an inheritance; he went out, not knowing where he was to go.
By faith he received power to generate, even though he was past the normal age --and Sarah herself was sterile--for he thought that the one who had made the promise was trustworthy.  So it was that there came forth from one man, himself as good as dead,
descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as countless as the sands on the seashore.</p>

<p>By faith Abraham, when put to the test, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was ready to offer his only son, of whom it was said, “Through Isaac descendants shall bear your name.”  He reasoned that God was able to raise even from the dead,
and he received Isaac back as a symbol.</p>

<p><b>The word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Luke 		            (Luke 2:22-40)</h3>
<p>When the days were completed for their purification according to the law of Moses, they took him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord, just as it is written in the law of the Lord, every male that opens the womb shall be consecrated to the Lord, and to offer the sacrifice of a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons,
in accordance with the dictate in the law of the Lord.</p>

<p>Now there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon.  This man was righteous and devout, awaiting the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.  It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the Christ of the Lord. He came in the Spirit into the temple;  and when the parents brought in the child Jesus to perform the custom of the law in regard to him,  He took him into his arms and blessed God, saying: “Now, Master, you may let your servant go in peace, according to your word, for my eyes have seen your salvation, which you prepared in sight of all the peoples, a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and glory for your people Israel.”
The child’s father and mother were amazed at what was said about him; and Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother, “Behold, this child is destined for the fall and rise of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be contradicted —and you yourself a sword will pierce—so that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.”  There was also a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher.  She was advanced in years, having lived seven years with her husband after her marriage,  and then as a widow until she was eighty-four.  She never left the temple, but worshiped night and day with fasting and prayer.  And coming forward at that very time, she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child
to all who were awaiting the redemption of Jerusalem. </p>

<p>When they had fulfilled all the prescriptions of the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth.  The child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom;
and the favor of God was upon him.</p>

<p><b>The Gospel of the Lord.</b><br>
―Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ</p>

<h3>For Reflection:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Today we hear about Abraham in both the First and Second Readings.  Because of his faith, God made possible what seemed impossible for Abraham, that he would become the Father of a multitude of nations.  Tell about a time in your life when you faced what appeared to be insurmountable challenges, but somehow God made possible what seemed impossible.
What impact did that experience have on your life and faith?</li>
<li>Today we celebrate the Feast of the Holy Family, and we hear that Joseph and Mary were obedient to the Law and presented Jesus in the temple with the prescribed sacrifice.  Simeon recognizes Jesus, and prophesizes over him.
Why were Joseph and Mary amazed at Simeon’s words about their son?</li>
<li>Simeon says to Mary, “and you yourself a sword will pierce…”  How does this prophecy help us to understand Mary’s role in God’s plan? </li>
</ol>

my Lord and my God!<br>
Amen.</p>

<p><b>Canticle of Zechariah (Luke 1:68-79)</b><br>

that he would save us from our enemies,<br>
