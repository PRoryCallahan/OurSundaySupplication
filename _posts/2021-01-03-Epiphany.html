<h1>Our Sunday Supplication</h1>

<h2>Sunday, January 3, 2021</h2>
<h3>The Solemnity of the Epiphany of the Lord</h3>

<p>Holy Mass is at the very core of our worship as a Catholic community. Nothing can ever be substituted for the celebration of the Eucharist. But in this exceptional time of difficulty for our communities, our nation, and the whole world, this order of prayer can be offered by individuals and families and engages us in our Sunday celebration of the Word of God. We can pray this prayer in our homes—the “domestic churches” which help build up the Body of Christ on earth—and thus be connected to the entire Church at prayer.</p>

<p>During this time of prayer, we include the opportunity to make a Spiritual Communion. Making a Spiritual Communion is a worthy practice, recommended by innumerable saints throughout the ages, which unites our whole selves to God and his Church.</p>

<h2>Order of Prayer</h2>
<p><b><i>Taken from the Mass and the Liturgy of the Hours</i></b></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><b>Leader:</b> God, ✠ come to my assistance.<br>
<b>Response:</b> Lord, make haste to help me.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
<b>Response:</b> as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.</p>

<h3>Hymn</h3>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/aRQf4u_71YA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Audio Recording</a></p>
<p><b>V.</b> What child is this, who, laid to rest,<br>
	On Mary’s lap is sleeping,<br>
	Whom angels greet with anthems sweet<br>
	While shepherds watch are keeping?</p>

<p><b>V.</b> Why lies he in such mean estate<br>
	Where ox and ass are feeding?<br>
	Good Christian, fear; for sinners here<br>
	The silent Word is pleading. <b>R.</b></p>

<p><b>R.</b> This, this is Christ the King.<br>
	Whom shepherds guard and angels sing;<br>
	Haste, haste to bring him laud,<br>
	The babe, the son of Mary.</p>

<p><b>V.</b> So bring him incense, gold, and myrrh;<br>
	Come, peasant, king, to own him.<br>
	The King of kings, salvation brings;<br>
	Let loving hearts enthrone him. <b>R.</b></p>

<h3>Act of Contrition</h3>
<p><b>Leader:</b> Let us acknowledge our sins, and seek the Lord’s pardon and peace.<br>
<br>
<b>Together:</b> I confess to almighty God<br>
and to you, my brothers and sisters,<br>
that I have greatly sinned,<br>
in my thoughts and in my words,<br>
in what I have done and in what I have failed to do,<br>
through my fault, through my fault,<br>
through my most grievous fault;<br>
therefore I ask blessed Mary ever-Virgin,<br>
all the Angels and Saints,<br>
and you, my brothers and sisters,<br>
to pray for me to the Lord our God.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b> May the splendor of your majesty,<br>
O Lord, we pray,<br>
shed its light upon our hearts,<br>
that we may pass through the shadows of this world<br>
and reach the brightness of our eternal home.<br>
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,<br>
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,<br>
one God, for ever and ever.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Amen.</p>

<h3>A reading from the Book of the Prophet Isaiah                     (Isaiah 60:1-6)</h3>
<p>Rise up in splendor, Jerusalem!  Your light has come, the glory of the Lord shines upon you.  See, darkness covers the earth, and thick clouds cover the peoples; but upon you the LORD shines, and over you appears his glory.  Nations shall walk by your light, and kings by your shining radiance.  Raise your eyes and look about; they all gather and come to you:
your sons come from afar, and your daughters in the arms of their nurses.</p>

<p>Then you shall be radiant at what you see, your heart shall throb and overflow, for the riches of the sea shall be emptied out before you, the wealth of nations shall be brought to you.  Caravans of camels shall fill you, dromedaries from Midian and Ephah; all from Sheba shall come bearing gold and frankincense,
and proclaiming the praises of the LORD.</p>

<p><b>The Word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>Responsorial Psalm    (Psalm 72:1-2, 7-8, 10-11, 12-13)</h3>
<p><b>Reader:</b> Lord, every nation on earth will adore you.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Lord, every nation on earth will adore you.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> O God, with your judgment endow the king,<br>
and with your justice, the king's son;<br>
He shall govern your people with justice<br>
and your afflicted ones with judgment.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Lord, every nation on earth will adore you.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> Justice shall flower in his days,<br>
and profound peace, till the moon be no more.<br>
May he rule from sea to sea,<br>
and from the River to the ends of the earth.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Lord, every nation on earth will adore you.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> The kings of Tarshish and the Isles shall offer gifts;<br>
the kings of Arabia and Seba shall bring tribute.<br>
All kings shall pay him homage,<br>
all nations shall serve him.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Lord, every nation on earth will adore you.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> For he shall rescue the poor when he cries out,<br>
and the afflicted when he has no one to help him.<br>
He shall have pity for the lowly and the poor;<br>
the lives of the poor he shall save.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Lord, every nation on earth will adore you.</p>

<h3>A Reading from the Letter of St. Paul to the Ephesians  	         (Ephesians 3:2-3a, 5-6)</h3>
<p>Brothers and sisters: You have heard of the stewardship of God's grace  that was given to me for your benefit, namely, that the mystery was made known to me by revelation.  It was not made known to people in other generations as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit: that the Gentiles are coheirs, members of the same body,
and copartners in the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel.</p>

<p><b>The word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Matthew 		           (Matthew 2:1-12)</h3>
<p>When Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of King Herod, behold, magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem, saying, "Where is the newborn king of the Jews?  We saw his star at its rising and have come to do him homage."  When King Herod heard this, he was greatly troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.  Assembling all the chief priests and the scribes of the people, He inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.  They said to him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it has been written through the prophet:  And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; since from you shall come a ruler, who is to shepherd my people Israel."  Then Herod called the magi secretly and ascertained from them the time of the star's appearance.  He sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and search diligently for the child. When you have found him, bring me word, that I too may go and do him homage." After their audience with the king they set out.  And behold, the star that they had seen at its rising preceded them, until it came and stopped over the place where the child was.  They were overjoyed at seeing the star, and on entering the house they saw the child with Mary his mother.  They prostrated themselves and did him homage.  Then they opened their treasures and offered him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.  And having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod,
they departed for their country by another way.</p>

<p><b>The Gospel of the Lord.</b><br>
―Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ</p>

<h3>For Reflection:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Our readings today speak to us of how Jesus came not just for a specific people in a specific time, but he came for all people.  How are we called to respond to this fact?
What is our role in making this a reality?</li>
<li>Why was Herod so troubled by the birth of Jesus?  There are many other people throughout the Gospels who respond to Jesus in a similar way.  What is it about Jesus that brings out this reaction from people, especially those in some position of power?
How might we also be tempted to react to Jesus in this way?</li>
<li>The Magi are directed in a dream to return to their country by another way.  As we move toward the conclusion of this Christmas season, how will you go forward from this
encounter with the newborn Jesus by a new way?</li>
</ol>

and unite myself wholly to you.<br>
Never permit me to be separated from you,<br>
my Lord and my God!<br>
Amen.</p>

<h2>Canticle of Praise</h2>
<p><b>Canticle of Zechariah (Luke 1:68-79)</b><br>

<b>Together:</b> ✠ Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel;<br>
he has come to his people and set them free.<br>
He has raised up for us a mighty savior,<br>
born of the house of his servant David.<br>
Through his holy prophets he promised of old<br>
that he would save us from our enemies,<br>
from the hands of all who hate us.<br>
He promised to show mercy to our fathers<br>
and to remember his holy covenant.<br>
This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham:<br>
to set us free from the hands of our enemies,<br>
free to worship him without fear,<br>
holy and righteous in his sight<br>
all the days of our life.<br>
You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High;<br>
for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way,<br>
to give his people knowledge of salvation<br>
by the forgiveness of their sins.<br>
In the tender compassion of our God<br>
the dawn from on high shall break upon us,<br>
to shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death,<br>
and to guide our feet into the way of peace.<br>
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,<br>
and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,<br>
world without end. Amen.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><b>Leader:</b> ✠ May the Lord bless us, protect us from all evil,
and bring us to everlasting life.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Amen.</p>
