<h1>Our Sunday Supplication</h1>

<h2>Sunday, January 10, 2021</h2>
<h3>Feast of the Baptism of the Lord</h3>

<p>Holy Mass is at the very core of our worship as a Catholic community. Nothing can ever be substituted for the celebration of the Eucharist. But in this exceptional time of difficulty for our communities, our nation, and the whole world, this order of prayer can be offered by individuals and families and engages us in our Sunday celebration of the Word of God. We can pray this prayer in our homes—the “domestic churches” which help build up the Body of Christ on earth—and thus be connected to the entire Church at prayer.</p>

<p>During this time of prayer, we include the opportunity to make a Spiritual Communion. Making a Spiritual Communion is a worthy practice, recommended by innumerable saints throughout the ages, which unites our whole selves to God and his Church.</p>

<h2>Order of Prayer</h2>
<p><b><i>Taken from the Mass and the Liturgy of the Hours</i></b></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><b>Leader:</b> God, ✠ come to my assistance.<br>
<b>Response:</b> Lord, make haste to help me.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
<b>Response:</b> as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.</p>

<h3>Hymn</h3>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/wz9hm-8XYkw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Audio Recording</a></p>
<p>To Jordan Jesus humbly came,<br>
His gospel mission to proclaim;<br>
On earth, in heav’n, God’s will was done<br>
By God’s beloved only Son.</p>

<p>John plunged him in that wat’ry grave;<br>
Christ rose to teach and heal and save,<br>
To show us how to die to sin<br>
And share eternal life with him.</p>

<p>God’s thund’ring voice the heavens rends,<br>
The Sprit’s might on him descends;<br>
The Word-made-Flesh, with grace infused,<br>
Anointed, goes to bring Good News.</p>

<p>God names us sons and daughters, too,<br>
In font and Spirit born anew;<br>
In Christ we die, with Christ we rise,<br>
Through Christ we enter paradise!</p>

<h3>Act of Contrition</h3>
<p><b>Leader:</b> Let us acknowledge our sins, and seek the Lord’s pardon and peace.<br>
<br>
<b>Together:</b> I confess to almighty God<br>
and to you, my brothers and sisters,<br>
that I have greatly sinned,<br>
in my thoughts and in my words,<br>
in what I have done and in what I have failed to do,<br>
through my fault, through my fault,<br>
through my most grievous fault;<br>
therefore I ask blessed Mary ever-Virgin,<br>
all the Angels and Saints,<br>
and you, my brothers and sisters,<br>
to pray for me to the Lord our God.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b> Almighty ever-living God,<br>
who, when Christ had been baptized in the River Jordan<br>
and as the Holy Spirit descended upon him,<br>
solemnly declared him your beloved Son,<br>
grant that your children by adoption,<br>
reborn of water and the Holy Spirit,<br>
may always be well pleasing to you.<br>
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,<br>
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,<br>
one God, for ever and ever.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Amen.</p>

<h3>A reading from the Book of the Prophet Isaiah               (Isaiah 55:1-11)</h3>
<p>Thus says the LORD: All you who are thirsty, come to the water!  You who have no money,
come, receive grain and eat; come, without paying and without cost, drink wine and milk!
Why spend your money for what is not bread, your wages for what fails to satisfy?  Heed me, and you shall eat well, you shall delight in rich fare.  Come to me heedfully, listen, that you may have life.  I will renew with you the everlasting covenant, the benefits assured to David.  As I made him a witness to the peoples, a leader and commander of nations, so shall you summon a nation you knew not, and nations that knew you not shall run to you,
because of the LORD, your God, the Holy One of Israel, who has glorified you.</p>

<p>Seek the LORD while he may be found, call him while he is near.  Let the scoundrel forsake his way, and the wicked man his thoughts; let him turn to the LORD for mercy; to our God, who is generous in forgiving.  For my thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways my ways, says the LORD.  As high as the heavens are above the earth so high are my ways above your ways
and my thoughts above your thoughts.</p>

<p>For just as from the heavens the rain and snow come down and do not return there till they have watered the earth, making it fertile and fruitful, giving seed to the one who sows and bread to the one who eats, so shall my word be that goes forth from my mouth; my word shall not return to me void, but shall do my will,
achieving the end for which I sent it.</p>

<p><b>The Word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>Responsorial Psalm    (Isaiah 12:2-3, 4bcd, 5-6)</h3>
<p><b>Reader:</b> You will draw water joyfully from the springs of salvation.<br>
<b>Together:</b> You will draw water joyfully from the springs of salvation.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> God indeed is my savior;<br>
I am confident and unafraid.<br>
My strength and my courage is the LORD,<br>
and he has been my savior.<br>
With joy you will draw water<br>
at the fountain of salvation.<br>
<b>Together:</b> You will draw water joyfully from the springs of salvation.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> Give thanks to the LORD, acclaim his name;<br>
among the nations make known his deeds,<br>
proclaim how exalted is his name.<br>
<b>Together:</b> You will draw water joyfully from the springs of salvation.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> Sing praise to the LORD for his glorious achievement;<br>
let this be known throughout all the earth.<br>
Shout with exultation, O city of Zion,<br>
for great in your midst<br>
is the Holy One of Israel!<br>
<b>Together:</b> You will draw water joyfully from the springs of salvation.</p>

<h3>A Reading from the first Letter of St. John  	        (1 John 5:1-9)</h3>
<p>Beloved: Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is begotten by God, and everyone who loves the Father loves also the one begotten by him.  In this way we know that we love the children of God when we love God and obey his commandments.  For the love of God is this, that we keep his commandments.  And his commandments are not burdensome, for whoever is begotten by God conquers the world.  And the victory that conquers the world is our faith.  Who indeed is the victor over the world but the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?</p>

<p>This is the one who came through water and blood, Jesus Christ, not by water alone, but by water and blood.  The Spirit is the one who testifies, and the Spirit is truth.  So there are three that testify, the Spirit, the water, and the blood, and the three are of one accord.  If we accept human testimony, the testimony of God is surely greater.  Now the testimony of God is this,
that he has testified on behalf of his Son.</p>

<p><b>The word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Mark    	     (Mark 1:7-11)</h3>
<p>This is what John the Baptist proclaimed: “One mightier than I is coming after me.  I am not worthy to stoop and loosen the thongs of his sandals.  I have baptized you with water;
he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”</p>

<p>It happened in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized in the Jordan by John.  On coming up out of the water he saw the heavens being torn open
and the Spirit, like a dove, descending upon him.  And a voice came from the heavens,
“You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.”</p>

<p><b>The Gospel of the Lord.</b><br>
―Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ</p>

<h3>For Reflection:</h3>
<ol>
<li>The prophet Isaiah speaks these words to us today:<br>
<br>
"For my thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways my ways, says the LORD.  As high as the heavens are above the earth so high are my ways above your ways and my thoughts above your thoughts."<br>
<br>
John tells us in the Second Reading:<br>
<br>
"For the love of God is this, that we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome, for whoever is begotten by God conquers the world."<br>
<br>
This is certainly an area in which God’s thoughts are frequently not our thoughts.  Many people experience God’s commandments as a burden rather than a gift. How do we grow in appreciation for God’s commandments so that we no longer see them as burdens but are able to recognize them as
a gift from a good Father to his beloved children?</li>
<li>When Jesus was baptized, a voice spoke from the heavens, “You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.”  Why was it critical both for Jesus and for the witnesses present to hear these words as he was beginning his public mission?
God speaks this same thing over each of us at our baptism.  Do you experience God’s love in this way?  Why or why not?</li>
</ol>

come at least spiritually into my heart.<br>
I embrace you as if you were already there<br>
and unite myself wholly to you.<br>
Never permit me to be separated from you,<br>
my Lord and my God!<br>
Amen.</p>

<h2>Canticle of Praise</h2>
<p><b>Canticle of Zechariah (Luke 1:68-79)</b><br>

<b>Together:</b> ✠ Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel;<br>
he has come to his people and set them free.<br>
He has raised up for us a mighty savior,<br>
born of the house of his servant David.<br>
Through his holy prophets he promised of old<br>
that he would save us from our enemies,<br>
from the hands of all who hate us.<br>
He promised to show mercy to our fathers<br>
and to remember his holy covenant.<br>
This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham:<br>
to set us free from the hands of our enemies,<br>
free to worship him without fear,<br>
holy and righteous in his sight<br>
all the days of our life.<br>
You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High;<br>
for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way,<br>
to give his people knowledge of salvation<br>
by the forgiveness of their sins.<br>
In the tender compassion of our God<br>
the dawn from on high shall break upon us,<br>
to shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death,<br>
and to guide our feet into the way of peace.<br>
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,<br>
and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,<br>
world without end. Amen.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

and bring us to everlasting life.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Amen.</p>
