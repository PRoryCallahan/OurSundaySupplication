<h1>Our Sunday Supplication</h1>

<h2>Sunday, January 17, 2021</h2>
<h3>The Second Sunday in Ordinary Time</h3>

<p>Holy Mass is at the very core of our worship as a Catholic community. Nothing can ever be substituted for the celebration of the Eucharist. But in this exceptional time of difficulty for our communities, our nation, and the whole world, this order of prayer can be offered by individuals and families and engages us in our Sunday celebration of the Word of God. We can pray this prayer in our homes—the “domestic churches” which help build up the Body of Christ on earth—and thus be connected to the entire Church at prayer.</p>

<p>During this time of prayer, we include the opportunity to make a Spiritual Communion. Making a Spiritual Communion is a worthy practice, recommended by innumerable saints throughout the ages, which unites our whole selves to God and his Church.</p>

<h2>Order of Prayer</h2>
<p><b><i>Taken from the Mass and the Liturgy of the Hours</i></b></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><b>Leader:</b> God, ✠ come to my assistance.<br>
<b>Response:</b> Lord, make haste to help me.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
<b>Response:</b> as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.</p>

<h3>Hymn</h3>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/5gJHZWl5Zz8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Audio Recording</a></p>
<p><b>V.</b> I want to walk as a child of the light.<br>
I want to follow Jesus.<br>
God set the stars to give light to the world.<br>
The star of my life is Jesus. <b>R.</b></p>

<p><b>R.</b> In him there is no darkness at all.<br>
	The night and the day are both alike.<br>
	The Lamb is the light of the city of God.<br>
	Shine in my heart, Lord Jesus.</p>

<p><b>V.</b> I want to see the brightness of God.<br>
	I want to look at Jesus.<br>
	Clear sun of righteousness shine on my path<br>
	And show me the way to the Father. <b>R.</b> </p>

<p><b>V.</b> I’m looking for the coming of Christ.<br>
	I want to be with Jesus.<br>
	When we have run with patience the race,<br>
	We shall know the joy of Jesus. <b>R.</b></p>

<h3>Act of Contrition</h3>
<p><b>Leader:</b> Let us acknowledge our sins, and seek the Lord’s pardon and peace.<br>
<br>
<b>Together:</b> I confess to almighty God<br>
and to you, my brothers and sisters,<br>
that I have greatly sinned,<br>
in my thoughts and in my words,<br>
in what I have done and in what I have failed to do,<br>
through my fault, through my fault,<br>
through my most grievous fault;<br>
therefore I ask blessed Mary ever-Virgin,<br>
all the Angels and Saints,<br>
and you, my brothers and sisters,<br>
to pray for me to the Lord our God.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b> Almighty ever-living God,<br>
	who govern all things,<br>
	both in heaven and on earth,<br>
	mercifully hear the pleading of your people<br>
	and bestow your peace on our times.<br>
	Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,<br>
	who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,<br>
  one God, for ever and ever.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Amen.</p>

<h2>The Sunday Readings</h2>

<h3>A reading from the first Book of Samuel               (1 Samuel 3:3b–10, 19)</h3>
<p>Samuel was sleeping in the temple of the LORD where the ark of God was.  The LORD called to Samuel, who answered, “Here I am.”  Samuel ran to Eli and said, “Here I am.  You called me.”
“I did not call you, “  Eli said.  “Go back to sleep.”  So he went back to sleep.  Again the LORD called Samuel, who rose and went to Eli.  “Here I am, “ he said.  “You called me.”
But Eli answered, “I did not call you, my son.  Go back to sleep.”</p>

<p>At that time Samuel was not familiar with the LORD, because the LORD had not revealed anything to him as yet.  The LORD called Samuel again, for the third time.
Getting up and going to Eli, he said, “Here I am.  You called me.”  Then Eli understood that the LORD was calling the youth.  So he said to Samuel,
“Go to sleep, and if you are called, reply, Speak, LORD, for your servant is listening.”  When Samuel went to sleep in his place, the LORD came and revealed his presence,
calling out as before, “Samuel, Samuel!”  Samuel answered, “Speak, for your servant is listening.”</p>

<p>Samuel grew up, and the LORD was with him, not permitting any word of his to be without effect.</p>

<p><b>The Word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>Responsorial Psalm    (Psalm 40:2, 4, 7–8, 8–9, 10)</h3>
<p><b>Reader:</b> Here am I, Lord; I come to do your will.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Here am I, Lord; I come to do your will.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> I have waited, waited for the LORD,<br>
and he stooped toward me and heard my cry.<br>
And he put a new song into my mouth,<br>
a hymn to our God.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Here am I, Lord; I come to do your will.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> Sacrifice or offering you wished not,<br>
but ears open to obedience you gave me.<br>
Holocausts or sin-offerings you sought not;<br>
then said I, “Behold I come.”<br>
<b>Together:</b> Here am I, Lord; I come to do your will.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> “In the written scroll it is prescribed for me,<br>
to do your will, O my God, is my delight,<br>
and your law is within my heart!”.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Here am I, Lord; I come to do your will.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> I announced your justice in the vast assembly;<br>
I did not restrain my lips, as you, O LORD, know.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Here am I, Lord; I come to do your will.</p>

<h3>A Reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Corinthians     (1 Corinthians 6:13c–15a, 17–20)</h3>
<p>Brothers and sisters: The body is not for immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord is for the body;
God raised the Lord and will also raise us by his power.</p>

<p>Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ?  But whoever is joined to the Lord becomes one Spirit with him.  Avoid immorality.  Every other sin a person commits is outside the body,
but the immoral person sins against his own body.  Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God, and that you are not your own?
For you have been purchased at a price.  Therefore glorify God in your body.</p>

<p><b>The word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>A reading from the holy Gospel according to John       	     (John 1:35–42)</h3>
<p>John was standing with two of his disciples, and as he watched Jesus walk by, he said,
“Behold, the Lamb of God.”  The two disciples heard what he said and followed Jesus.
Jesus turned and saw them following him and said to them, “What are you looking for?”
They said to him, “Rabbi” — which translated means Teacher —“where are you staying?”
He said to them, “Come, and you will see.”  So they went and saw where Jesus was staying,
and they stayed with him that day.  It was about four in the afternoon.
Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two who heard John and followed Jesus.
He first found his own brother Simon and told him, “We have found the Messiah” — which is translated Christ —.
Then he brought him to Jesus.  Jesus looked at him and said, “You are Simon the son of John; you will be called Cephas” —
which is translated Peter.</p>

<p><b>The Gospel of the Lord.</b><br>
―Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ</p>

<h3>For Reflection:</h3>
<ol>
<li>We read in the passage from 1 Samuel, “At that time Samuel was not familiar with the LORD, because the LORD had not revealed anything to him as yet.” This reading tells us that we learn to recognize the voice of the Lord as he works in our lives and speaks to us over time.  Have you had the experience of becoming acquainted with the Lord in this way?  If so, how has he revealed himself to you?
If not, what does this reading help you to understand about growing familiar with the Lord?</li>
<li>St. Paul tells us, “…your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you…Therefore glorify God in your body.”
How do we glorify God in our bodies?</li>
<li>After spending one day with Jesus, Andrew was convinced that he had found the Messiah.
What do you think it was about Jesus that made Andrew so confident about Jesus’ identity?</li>
</ol>

Never permit me to be separated from you,<br>
my Lord and my God!<br>
Amen.</p>

<h2>Canticle of Praise</h2>
<p><b>Canticle of Zechariah (Luke 1:68-79)</b><br>

<b>Together:</b> ✠ Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel;<br>
he has come to his people and set them free.<br>
He has raised up for us a mighty savior,<br>
born of the house of his servant David.<br>
Through his holy prophets he promised of old<br>
that he would save us from our enemies,<br>
from the hands of all who hate us.<br>
He promised to show mercy to our fathers<br>
and to remember his holy covenant.<br>
This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham:<br>
to set us free from the hands of our enemies,<br>
free to worship him without fear,<br>
holy and righteous in his sight<br>
all the days of our life.<br>
You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High;<br>
for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way,<br>
to give his people knowledge of salvation<br>
by the forgiveness of their sins.<br>
In the tender compassion of our God<br>
the dawn from on high shall break upon us,<br>
to shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death,<br>
and to guide our feet into the way of peace.<br>
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,<br>
and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,<br>
world without end. Amen.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

and bring us to everlasting life.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Amen.</p>
