<h1>Our Sunday Supplication</h1>

<h2>Sunday, January 31, 2021</h2>
<h3>The Fourth Sunday in Ordinary Time</h3>

<p>Holy Mass is at the very core of our worship as a Catholic community. Nothing can ever be substituted for the celebration of the Eucharist. But in this exceptional time of difficulty for our communities, our nation, and the whole world, this order of prayer can be offered by individuals and families and engages us in our Sunday celebration of the Word of God. We can pray this prayer in our homes—the “domestic churches” which help build up the Body of Christ on earth—and thus be connected to the entire Church at prayer.</p>

<p>During this time of prayer, we include the opportunity to make a Spiritual Communion. Making a Spiritual Communion is a worthy practice, recommended by innumerable saints throughout the ages, which unites our whole selves to God and his Church.</p>

<h2>Order of Prayer</h2>
<p><b><i>Taken from the Mass and the Liturgy of the Hours</i></b></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><b>Leader:</b> O God, ✠ come to my assistance.<br>
<b>Response:</b> O Lord, make haste to help me.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
<b>Response:</b> as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.</p>

<h3>Hymn</h3>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/nMSboqdbyrE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Audio Recording</a></p>
<p>Holy God, we praise thy name;<br>
Lord of all, we bow before thee!<br>
All on earth thy scepter claim,<br>
All in heav’n above adore thee;<br>
Infinite thy vast domain, <br>
everlasting is thy reign.<br>
Infinite thy vast domain, <br>
everlasting is thy reign.</p>

<p>Hark! the loud celestial hymn<br>
Angel choirs above are raising;<br>
Cherubim and Seraphim,<br>
In unceasing chorus praising,<br>
Fill the heav’ns with sweet accord:<br>
“Holy, holy, holy Lord!”<br>
Fill the heav’ns with sweet accord: <br>
“Holy, holy, holy Lord!”</p>

<p>Holy Father, Holy Son,<br>
Holy Spirit, Three we name thee;<br>
While in essence only One,<br>
Undivided God we claim thee;<br>
And adoring bend the knee,<br>
While we own the mystery.<br>
And adoring bend the knee,<br>
While we own the mystery.</p>

<h3>Act of Contrition</h3>
<p><b>Leader:</b> Let us acknowledge our sins, and seek the Lord’s pardon and peace.<br>
<br>
<b>Together:</b> I confess to almighty God<br>
and to you, my brothers and sisters,<br>
that I have greatly sinned,<br>
in my thoughts and in my words,<br>
in what I have done and in what I have failed to do,<br>
through my fault, through my fault,<br>
through my most grievous fault;<br>
therefore I ask blessed Mary ever-Virgin,<br>
all the Angels and Saints,<br>
and you, my brothers and sisters,<br>
to pray for me to the Lord our God.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b> Grant us, Lord our God,<br>
that we may honor you with all our mind,<br>
and love everyone in truth of heart.<br>
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,<br>
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,<br>
one God, for ever and ever.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Amen.</p>

<h2>The Sunday Readings</h2>
<p><a href="https://bible.usccb.org/podcasts/audio/2021-01-31-usccb-daily-mass-readings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">USCCB Audio Recording of Sunday Readings</a></p>
<h3>A reading from the Book of Deuteronomy               (Deuteronomy 18:15-20)</h3>
<p>Moses spoke to all the people, saying: “A prophet like me will the LORD, your God, raise up for you from among your own kin; to him you shall listen.
This is exactly what you requested of the LORD, your God, at Horeb on the day of the assembly, when you said, ‘Let us not again hear the voice of the LORD, our God, nor see this great fire any more, lest we die.’
And the LORD said to me, ‘This was well said.  I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their kin, and will put my words into his mouth;
he shall tell them all that I command him.  Whoever will not listen to my words which he speaks in my name, I myself will make him answer for it.
But if a prophet presumes to speak in my name an oracle that I have not commanded him to speak,
or speaks in the name of other gods, he shall die.’”</p>

<p><b>The Word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>Responsorial Psalm    (Psalm 95:1-2, 6-7, 7-9)</h3>
<p><b>Reader:</b> If today you hear his voice, harden not your hearts.<br>
<b>Together:</b> If today you hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> Come, let us sing joyfully to the LORD;<br>
let us acclaim the rock of our salvation.<br>
Let us come into his presence with thanksgiving;<br>
let us joyfully sing psalms to him.<br>
<b>Together:</b> If today you hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> Come, let us bow down in worship;<br>
let us kneel before the LORD who made us.<br>
For he is our God,<br>
and we are the people he shepherds, the flock he guides.<br>
<b>Together:</b> If today you hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> Oh, that today you would hear his voice:<br>
“Harden not your hearts as at Meribah,<br>
as in the day of Massah in the desert,<br>
Where your fathers tempted me;<br>
they tested me though they had seen my works.”<br>
<b>Together:</b> If today you hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</p>

<h3>A Reading from the first Letter of Saint Paul to the Corinthians       (1 Corinthians 7:32-35)</h3>
<p>Brothers and sisters: I should like you to be free of anxieties.  An unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord.  But a married man is anxious about the things of the world, how he may please his wife, and he is divided.  An unmarried woman or a virgin is anxious about the things of the Lord, so that she may be holy in both body and spirit.  A married woman, on the other hand, is anxious about the things of the world, how she may please her husband.  I am telling you this for your own benefit, not to impose a restraint upon you,
but for the sake of propriety and adherence to the Lord without distraction.</p>

<p><b>The word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Mark 		             (Mark 1:21-28)</h3>
<p>Then they came to Capernaum, and on the sabbath Jesus entered the synagogue and taught.  The people were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as one having authority and not as the scribes.  In their synagogue was a man with an unclean spirit;
he cried out, “What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth?  Have you come to destroy us?  I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”  Jesus rebuked him and said,
“Quiet!  Come out of him!”  The unclean spirit convulsed him and with a loud cry came out of him.  All were amazed and asked one another, “What is this?  A new teaching with authority.  He commands even the unclean spirits and they obey him.”
His fame spread everywhere throughout the whole region of Galilee.</p>

<p><b>The Gospel of the Lord.</b><br>
―Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ</p>

<h3>For Reflection:</h3>
<ol>
<li>What word or phrase from the readings today stands out to you?  What might God be calling to your attention
through that word or phrase?</li>
<li>What causes you anxiety?  How is it that a single-minded focus on the things of the Lord frees us from anxiety?  Taking into account your state in life, (single, married or widowed),
how can you put this teaching into practice?</li>
<li>We hear in the Gospel that Jesus taught with authority, unlike the scribes.
How do we see this authority in Jesus’ words and actions?</li>
</ol>

come at least spiritually into my heart.<br>
I embrace you as if you were already there<br>
and unite myself wholly to you.<br>
Never permit me to be separated from you,<br>
my Lord and my God!<br>
Amen.</p>

<h2>Canticle of Praise</h2>
<p><b>Canticle of Zechariah (Luke 1:68-79)</b><br>

<b>Together:</b> ✠ Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel;<br>
he has come to his people and set them free.<br>
He has raised up for us a mighty savior,<br>
born of the house of his servant David.<br>
Through his holy prophets he promised of old<br>
that he would save us from our enemies,<br>
from the hands of all who hate us.<br>
He promised to show mercy to our fathers<br>
and to remember his holy covenant.<br>
This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham:<br>
to set us free from the hands of our enemies,<br>
free to worship him without fear,<br>
holy and righteous in his sight<br>
all the days of our life.<br>
You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High;<br>
for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way,<br>
to give his people knowledge of salvation<br>
by the forgiveness of their sins.<br>
In the tender compassion of our God<br>
the dawn from on high shall break upon us,<br>
to shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death,<br>
and to guide our feet into the way of peace.<br>
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,<br>
and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,<br>
world without end. Amen.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><b>Leader:</b> ✠ May the Lord bless us, protect us from all evil,
and bring us to everlasting life.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Amen.</p>
