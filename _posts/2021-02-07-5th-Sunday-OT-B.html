<h1>Our Sunday Supplication</h1>

<h2>Sunday, February 7, 2021</h2>
<h3>The Fifth Sunday in Ordinary Time</h3>

<p>Holy Mass is at the very core of our worship as a Catholic community. Nothing can ever be substituted for the celebration of the Eucharist. But in this exceptional time of difficulty for our communities, our nation, and the whole world, this order of prayer can be offered by individuals and families and engages us in our Sunday celebration of the Word of God. We can pray this prayer in our homes—the “domestic churches” which help build up the Body of Christ on earth—and thus be connected to the entire Church at prayer.</p>

<p>During this time of prayer, we include the opportunity to make a Spiritual Communion. Making a Spiritual Communion is a worthy practice, recommended by innumerable saints throughout the ages, which unites our whole selves to God and his Church.</p>

<h2>Order of Prayer</h2>
<p><b><i>Taken from the Mass and the Liturgy of the Hours</i></b></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><b>Leader:</b> O God, ✠ come to my assistance.<br>
<b>Response:</b> O Lord, make haste to help me.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
<b>Response:</b> as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.</p>

<h3>Hymn</h3>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/_Cu75iN0qKw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Audio Recording</a></p>
<p>Joyful, joyful, we adore you,<br>
God of glory, Lord of love;<br>
Hearts unfold like flow’rs before you,<br>
Op’ning to the sun above.<br>
Melt the clouds of sin and sadness<br>
Drive the dark of doubt away;<br>
Giver of immortal gladness,<br>
Fill us with the light of day.</p>

<p>All your works with joy surround you,<br>
Earth and heav’n reflect your rays,<br>
Stars and angels sing around you,<br>
Center of unbroken praise.<br>
Field and forest, vale and mountain,<br>
Flow’ry meadow, flashing sea,<br>
Chanting bird, and flowing fountain<br>
Sound their praise eternally!</p>

<p>You are giving and forgiving,<br>
Ever blessing, ever blest,<br>
Wellspring of the joy of living,<br>
Ocean-depth of happy rest!<br>
God our Father, Christ our brother,<br>
Let your light upon us shine;<br>
Teach us how to love each other,<br>
Lift us to the joy divine.</p>

<h3>Act of Contrition</h3>
<p><b>Leader:</b> Let us acknowledge our sins, and seek the Lord’s pardon and peace.<br>
<br>
<b>Together:</b> I confess to almighty God<br>
and to you, my brothers and sisters,<br>
that I have greatly sinned,<br>
in my thoughts and in my words,<br>
in what I have done and in what I have failed to do,<br>
through my fault, through my fault,<br>
through my most grievous fault;<br>
therefore I ask blessed Mary ever-Virgin,<br>
all the Angels and Saints,<br>
and you, my brothers and sisters,<br>
to pray for me to the Lord our God.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b> Keep your family safe, O Lord,<br>
with unfailing care, that,<br>
relying solely on the hope of heavenly grace,<br>
they may be defended always by your protection.<br>
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,<br>
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,<br>
one God, for ever and ever.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Amen.</p>

<h3>A reading from the Book of the Job		             (Job 7:1-4, 6-7)</h3>
<p>Job spoke, saying: Is not man’s life on earth a drudgery?  Are not his days those of  hirelings?  He is a slave who longs for the shade, a hireling who waits for his wages.  So I have been assigned months of misery, and troubled nights have been allotted to me.  If in bed I say, “When shall I arise?” then the night drags on; I am filled with restlessness until the dawn.  My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle; they come to an end without hope.  Remember that my life is like the wind; I shall not see happiness again.</p>

<p><b>The Word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>Responsorial Psalm            (Psalm 147:1-2, 3-4, 5-6)</h3>
<p><b>Reader:</b> Praise the Lord, who heals the brokenhearted.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Praise the Lord, who heals the brokenhearted.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> Praise the LORD, for he is good;<br>
sing praise to our God, for he is gracious;<br>
it is fitting to praise him.<br>
The LORD rebuilds Jerusalem;<br>
the dispersed of Israel he gathers.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Praise the Lord, who heals the brokenhearted.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> He heals the brokenhearted<br>
and binds up their wounds.<br>
He tells the number of the stars;<br>
he calls each by name.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Praise the Lord, who heals the brokenhearted.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> Great is our Lord and mighty in power;<br>
to his wisdom there is no limit.<br>
The LORD sustains the lowly;<br>
the wicked he casts to the ground.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Praise the Lord, who heals the brokenhearted.</p>

<h3>A Reading from the first Letter of Saint Paul to the Corinthians       (1 Corinthians 9:16-19, 22-23)</h3>
<p>Brothers and sisters: If I preach the gospel, this is no reason for me to boast, for an obligation has been imposed on me, and woe to me if I do not preach it!  If I do so willingly, I have a recompense, but if unwillingly, then I have been entrusted with a stewardship.  What then is my recompense?
That, when I preach, I offer the gospel free of charge so as not to make full use of my right in the gospel.</p>

<p>Although I am free in regard to all, I have made myself a slave to all so as to win over as many as possible.  To the weak I became weak, to win over the weak.  I have become all things to all, to save at least some.
All this I do for the sake of the gospel, so that I too may have a share in it.</p>

<p><b>The word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Mark 		             (Mark 1:29-39)</h3>
<p>On leaving the synagogue Jesus entered the house of Simon and Andrew with James and John.  Simon’s mother-in-law lay sick with a fever.  They immediately told him about her.
He approached, grasped her hand, and helped her up.  Then the fever left her and she waited on them.</p>

<p>When it was evening, after sunset, they brought to him all who were ill or possessed by demons.  The whole town was gathered at the door.  He cured many who were sick with various diseases, a
and he drove out many demons, not permitting them to speak because they knew him.</p>

<p>Rising very early before dawn, he left and went off to a deserted place, where he prayed.
Simon and those who were with him pursued him and on finding him said, “Everyone is looking for you.”  He told them, “Let us go on to the nearby villages that I may preach there also.  For this purpose have I come.”
So he went into their synagogues, preaching and driving out demons throughout the whole of Galilee.</p>

<p><b>The Gospel of the Lord.</b><br>
―Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ</p>

<h3>For Reflection:</h3>
<ol>
<li>God allowed Job to be greatly tested.  We hear Job’s lament today.  Have you ever felt the way that Job describes in today’s reading?
What has sustained you through those times?</li>
<li>We hear in the Psalm that God heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.  In the Gospel, we see Jesus doing just that with those who are ill or possessed by demons.
Why does God have such compassion on those who are broken and suffering?</li>
<li>Jesus was constantly pursued by people seeking him out because of their great need.  We see him in today’s Gospel rising before dawn to go to a place where he could be alone and pray.
What does his example teach us about the importance of prayer?</li>
</ol>

come at least spiritually into my heart.<br>
I embrace you as if you were already there<br>
and unite myself wholly to you.<br>
Never permit me to be separated from you,<br>
my Lord and my God!<br>
Amen.</p>

<h2>Canticle of Praise</h2>
<p><b>Canticle of Zechariah (Luke 1:68-79)</b><br>

<b>Together:</b> ✠ Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel;<br>
he has come to his people and set them free.<br>
He has raised up for us a mighty savior,<br>
born of the house of his servant David.<br>
Through his holy prophets he promised of old<br>
that he would save us from our enemies,<br>
from the hands of all who hate us.<br>
He promised to show mercy to our fathers<br>
and to remember his holy covenant.<br>
This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham:<br>
to set us free from the hands of our enemies,<br>
free to worship him without fear,<br>
holy and righteous in his sight<br>
all the days of our life.<br>
You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High;<br>
for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way,<br>
to give his people knowledge of salvation<br>
by the forgiveness of their sins.<br>
In the tender compassion of our God<br>
the dawn from on high shall break upon us,<br>
to shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death,<br>
and to guide our feet into the way of peace.<br>
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,<br>
and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,<br>
world without end. Amen.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

and bring us to everlasting life.<br>
