<h1>Our Sunday Supplication</h1>

<h2>Sunday, March 7, 2021</h2>
<h3>The Third Sunday of Lent</h3>

<p>Holy Mass is at the very core of our worship as a Catholic community. Nothing can ever be substituted for the celebration of the Eucharist. But in this exceptional time of difficulty for our communities, our nation, and the whole world, this order of prayer can be offered by individuals and families and engages us in our Sunday celebration of the Word of God. We can pray this prayer in our homes—the “domestic churches” which help build up the Body of Christ on earth—and thus be connected to the entire Church at prayer.</p>

<p>During this time of prayer, we include the opportunity to make a Spiritual Communion. Making a Spiritual Communion is a worthy practice, recommended by innumerable saints throughout the ages, which unites our whole selves to God and his Church.</p>

<h2>Order of Prayer</h2>
<p><b><i>Taken from the Mass and the Liturgy of the Hours</i></b></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><b>Leader:</b> O God, ✠ come to my assistance.<br>
<b>Response:</b> O Lord, make haste to help me.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
<b>Response:</b> as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.</p>

<h3>Hymn</h3>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/3arJ10pgea8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Audio Recording</a></p>
<p>Lord, who throughout these forty days<br>
For us did fast and pray,<br>
Teach us to overcome our sins,<br>
And close by you to stay.</p>

<p>As you with Satan did contend<br>
And did the vict’ry win,<br>
O give us strength in you to fight,<br>
In you to conquer sin.</p>

<p>As you did hunger and did thirst,<br>
So teach us, gracious Lord,<br>
To die to self, and only live<br>
By your most holy word.</p>

<p>And through these days of penitence,<br>
And through your Passiontide,<br>
For evermore, in life and death,<br>
O Lord, with us abide.</p>

<p>Abide with us that, when this life<br>
Of suffering is past,<br>
An Easter of unending joy<br>
We may attain at last!</p>


<h3>Act of Contrition</h3>
<p><b>Leader:</b> Let us acknowledge our sins, and seek the Lord’s pardon and peace.<br>
<br>
<b>Together:</b> I confess to almighty God<br>
and to you, my brothers and sisters,<br>
that I have greatly sinned,<br>
in my thoughts and in my words,<br>
in what I have done and in what I have failed to do,<br>
through my fault, through my fault,<br>
through my most grievous fault;<br>
therefore I ask blessed Mary ever-Virgin,<br>
all the Angels and Saints,<br>
and you, my brothers and sisters,<br>
to pray for me to the Lord our God.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b> O God, author of every mercy and of all goodness,<br>
who in fasting, prayer and almsgiving<br>
have shown us a remedy for sin,<br>
look graciously on this confession of our lowliness,<br>
that we, who are bowed down by our conscience,<br>
may always be lifted up by your mercy.<br>
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,<br>
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,<br>
God, for ever and ever.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Amen.</p>

<h3>A reading from the Book of Exodus                              (Exodus 20:1-17)</h3>
<p>In those days, God delivered all these commandments: “I, the LORD, am your God,
who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that place of slavery.  You shall not have other gods besides me.  You shall not carve idols for yourselves in the shape of anything in the sky above or on the earth below or in the waters beneath the earth; you shall not bow down before them or worship them.  For I, the LORD, your God, am a jealous God,
inflicting punishment for their fathers’ wickedness on the children of those who hate me, down to the third and fourth generation;
but bestowing mercy down to the thousandth generation on the children of those who love me and keep my commandments.</p>

<p>“You shall not take the name of the LORD, your God, in vain.  For the LORD will not leave unpunished the one who takes his name in vain.  “Remember to keep holy the sabbath day.  Six days you may labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD, your God.  No work may be done then either by you, or your son or daughter, or your male or female slave, or your beast, or by the alien who lives with you.  In six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea and all that is in them; but on the seventh day he rested.  That is why the LORD has blessed the sabbath day and made it holy.</p>

<p>“Honor your father and your mother, that you may have a long life in the land which the LORD, your God, is giving you.  You shall not kill.  You shall not commit adultery.
You shall not steal.  You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.  You shall not covet your neighbor’s house.  You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, nor his male or female slave,
nor his ox or ass, nor anything else that belongs to him.”</p>

<p><b>The Word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>Responsorial Psalm            (Psalm 19:8, 9, 10, 11)</h3>
<p><b>Reader:</b> Lord, you have the words of everlasting life.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Lord, you have the words of everlasting life.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> The law of the LORD is perfect,<br>
refreshing the soul;<br>
The decree of the LORD is trustworthy,<br>
giving wisdom to the simple.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Lord, you have the words of everlasting life.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> The precepts of the LORD are right,<br>
rejoicing the heart;<br>
the command of the LORD is clear,<br>
enlightening the eye.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Lord, you have the words of everlasting life.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> The fear of the LORD is pure,<br>
enduring forever;<br>
the ordinances of the LORD are true,<br>
all of them just.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Lord, you have the words of everlasting life.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> They are more precious than gold,<br>
than a heap of purest gold;<br>
sweeter also than syrup<br>
or honey from the comb.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Lord, you have the words of everlasting life.</p>

<h3>A Reading from the first Letter of Saint Paul to the Corinthians         (1 Corinthians 1:22-25)</h3>
<p>Brothers and sisters: Jews demand signs and Greeks look for wisdom, but we proclaim Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles, but to those who are called, Jews and Greeks alike, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.  For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom,
and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength.</p>

<p><b>The word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>A reading from the holy Gospel according to John		              (John 2:13-25)</h3>
<p>Since the Passover of the Jews was near, Jesus went up to Jerusalem.  He found in the temple area those who sold oxen, sheep, and doves, as well as the money changers seated there.  He made a whip out of cords and drove them all out of the temple area, with the sheep and oxen, and spilled the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables, and to those who sold doves he said, “Take these out of here, and stop making my Father’s house a marketplace.”  His disciples recalled the words of Scripture, <em>Zeal for your house will consume me.</em> At this the Jews answered and said to him, “What sign can you show us for doing this?”  Jesus answered and said to them, “Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.”  The Jews said, “This temple has been under construction for forty-six years, and you will raise it up in three days?”  But he was speaking about the temple of his body.  Therefore, when he was raised from the dead,
his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they came to believe the Scripture and the word Jesus had spoken.</p>

<p>While he was in Jerusalem for the feast of Passover, many began to believe in his name
when they saw the signs he was doing.  But Jesus would not trust himself to them because he knew them all, and did not need anyone to testify about human nature.
He himself understood it well.</p>

<p><b>The Gospel of the Lord.</b><br>
―Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ</p>

<h3>For Reflection:</h3>
<ol>
<li>We often think of the commandments that concern our actions toward other people, but the first three commandments focus on our relationship with God.  Why does God command us to not have other gods, to respect the name of God and to set aside one day of the week for the worship of God?  Why is it not
enough to observe only the commandments that relate to our fellow human beings?</li>
<li>Even in the earliest days of the Church, belief in the crucified Christ was considered “a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles.”
How do Christians find wisdom and strength in the crucifixion where others only see weakness and foolishness?</li>
<li>We hear at the end of the Gospel that many people came to believe in Jesus because of the signs he did, but that because of his understanding of human nature, he would not trust himself to them.  What did Jesus understand about the belief of these people that made him so untrusting?  How can we ground our belief in Jesus so that our faith is not dependent on
signs and wonders but endures even in the face of trials?</li>
</ol>

and unite myself wholly to you.<br>
Never permit me to be separated from you,<br>
my Lord and my God!<br>
Amen.</p>

<h2>Canticle of Praise</h2>
<p><b>Canticle of Zechariah (Luke 1:68-79)</b><br>

<b>Together:</b> ✠ Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel;<br>
he has come to his people and set them free.<br>
He has raised up for us a mighty savior,<br>
born of the house of his servant David.<br>
Through his holy prophets he promised of old<br>
that he would save us from our enemies,<br>
from the hands of all who hate us.<br>
He promised to show mercy to our fathers<br>
and to remember his holy covenant.<br>
This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham:<br>
to set us free from the hands of our enemies,<br>
free to worship him without fear,<br>
holy and righteous in his sight<br>
all the days of our life.<br>
You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High;<br>
for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way,<br>
to give his people knowledge of salvation<br>
by the forgiveness of their sins.<br>
In the tender compassion of our God<br>
the dawn from on high shall break upon us,<br>
to shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death,<br>
and to guide our feet into the way of peace.<br>
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,<br>
and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,<br>
world without end. Amen.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

and bring us to everlasting life.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Amen.</p>
