<h1>Our Sunday Supplication</h1>

<h2>Sunday, March 14, 2021</h2>
<h3>The Fourth Sunday of Lent</h3>

<p>Holy Mass is at the very core of our worship as a Catholic community. Nothing can ever be substituted for the celebration of the Eucharist. But in this exceptional time of difficulty for our communities, our nation, and the whole world, this order of prayer can be offered by individuals and families and engages us in our Sunday celebration of the Word of God. We can pray this prayer in our homes—the “domestic churches” which help build up the Body of Christ on earth—and thus be connected to the entire Church at prayer.</p>

<p>During this time of prayer, we include the opportunity to make a Spiritual Communion. Making a Spiritual Communion is a worthy practice, recommended by innumerable saints throughout the ages, which unites our whole selves to God and his Church.</p>

<h2>Order of Prayer</h2>
<p><b><i>Taken from the Mass and the Liturgy of the Hours</i></b></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><b>Leader:</b> O God, ✠ come to my assistance.<br>
<b>Response:</b> O Lord, make haste to help me.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
<b>Response:</b> as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.</p>

<h3>Hymn</h3>

<p>What wondrous love is this,<br>
O my soul, O my soul!<br>
What wondrous love is this, O my soul!<br>
What wondrous love is this<br>
that caused the Lord of bliss<br>
To bear the dreadful curse<br>
for my soul, for my soul;<br>
To bear the dreadful curse for my soul!</p>

<p>To God and to the Lamb<br>
I will sing, I will sing;<br>
To God and to the Lamb I will sing.<br>
To God and to the Lamb,<br>
who is the great I AM,<br>
While millions join the theme,<br>
I will sing, I will sing;<br>
While millions join the theme, I will sing.</p>

<p>And when from death I’m free,<br>
I’ll sing on, I’ll sing on;<br>
And when from death I’m free, I’ll sing on.<br>
And when from death I’m free,<br>
I’ll sing and joyful be,<br>
And through eternity<br>
I’ll sing on, I’ll sing on;<br>
And through eternity I’ll sing on.</p>

<h3>Act of Contrition</h3>
<p><b>Leader:</b> Let us acknowledge our sins, and seek the Lord’s pardon and peace.<br>
<br>
<b>Together:</b> I confess to almighty God<br>
and to you, my brothers and sisters,<br>
that I have greatly sinned,<br>
in my thoughts and in my words,<br>
in what I have done and in what I have failed to do,<br>
through my fault, through my fault,<br>
through my most grievous fault;<br>
therefore I ask blessed Mary ever-Virgin,<br>
all the Angels and Saints,<br>
and you, my brothers and sisters,<br>
to pray for me to the Lord our God.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b> O God, who through your Word<br>
reconcile the human race to yourself in a wonderful way,<br>
grant, we pray,<br>
that with prompt devotion and eager faith<br>
the Christian people may hasten<br>
toward the solemn celebrations to come.<br>
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,<br>
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,<br>
God, for ever and ever.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Amen.</p>

<h2>The Sunday Readings</h2>

<h3>A reading from the Second Book of Chronicles            (2 Chr 36:14-16, 19-23)</h3>
<p>In those days, all the princes of Judah, the priests, and the people added infidelity to infidelity, practicing all the abominations of the nations
and polluting the LORD’s temple which he had consecrated in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Early and often did the LORD, the God of their fathers, send his messengers to them, for he had compassion on his people and his dwelling place. But they mocked the messengers of God, despised his warnings, and scoffed at his prophets, until the anger of the LORD against his people was so inflamed that there was no remedy. Their enemies burnt the house of God, tore down the walls of Jerusalem, set all its palaces afire, and destroyed all its precious objects. Those who escaped the sword were carried captive to Babylon, where they became servants of the king of the Chaldeans and his sons until the kingdom of the Persians came to power. All this was to fulfill the word of the LORD spoken by Jeremiah: “Until the land has retrieved its lost sabbaths, during all the time it lies waste
it shall have rest while seventy years are fulfilled.”</p>

<p>In the first year of Cyrus, king of Persia, in order to fulfill the word of the LORD spoken by Jeremiah, the LORD inspired King Cyrus of Persia to issue this proclamation throughout his kingdom, both by word of mouth and in writing: “Thus says Cyrus, king of Persia: All the kingdoms of the earth the LORD, the God of heaven, has given to me, and he has also charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whoever, therefore, among you belongs to any part of his people, let him go up, and may his God be with him!”</p>

<p><b>The Word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>Responsorial Psalm            (Psalm 137:1-2, 3, 4-5, 6)</h3>
<p><b>Reader:</b> Let my tongue be silenced, if I ever forget you!<br>
<b>Together:</b> Let my tongue be silenced, if I ever forget you!</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> By the streams of Babylon<br>
we sat and wept<br>
when we remembered Zion.<br>
On the aspens of that land<br>
we hung up our harps.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Let my tongue be silenced, if I ever forget you!</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> For there our captors asked of us<br>
the lyrics of our songs,<br>
And our despoilers urged us to be joyous:<br>
“Sing for us the songs of Zion!”<br>
<b>Together:</b> Let my tongue be silenced, if I ever forget you!</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> How could we sing a song of the LORD<br>
in a foreign land?<br>
If I forget you, Jerusalem,<br>
may my right hand be forgotten!<br>
<b>Together:</b> Let my tongue be silenced, if I ever forget you!</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> May my tongue cleave to my palate<br>
if I remember you not,<br>
If I place not Jerusalem<br>
ahead of my joy.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Let my tongue be silenced, if I ever forget you!</p>

<h3>A Reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Ephesians         (Ephesians 2:4-10)</h3>
<p>Brothers and sisters:</p>
<p>God, who is rich in mercy, because of the great love he had for us, even when we were dead in our transgressions, brought us to life with Christ — by grace you have been saved —, raised us up with him, and seated us with him in the heavens in Christ Jesus, that in the ages to come he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus. For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not from you; it is the gift of God; it is not from works, so no one may boast. For we are his handiwork, created in Christ Jesus for the good works that God has prepared in advance,
that we should live in them.</p>

<p><b>The word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>A reading from the holy Gospel according to John		              (John 3:14-21)</h3>
<p>Jesus said to Nicodemus: “Just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,
so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.”</p>

<p>For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him might not perish but might have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through him. Whoever believes in him will not be condemned, but whoever does not believe has already been condemned, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. And this is the verdict, that the light came into the world, but people preferred darkness to light, because their works were evil. For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come toward the light, so that his works might not be exposed. But whoever lives the truth comes to the light,
so that his works may be clearly seen as done in God.</p>

<p><b>The Gospel of the Lord.</b><br>
―Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ</p>

<h3>For Reflection:</h3>
<ol>
<li>As you meditate upon today’s readings, what words, phrases, or images stand our in your mind and heart?
What is God saying to you through his Word?</li>
<li>In todays’ Gospel, we hear that “whoever lives in the truth comes to the light, so that his works might be clearly seen as done in God.” Are there any areas of your life that are shrouded in darkness and in need of Christ’s redemption? How might God be asking you to bring these areas of your life
out of darkness and into the light of Christ?</li>
<li>In the Second Reading, St. Paul reminds us that we cannot earn our own salvation; rather, it is a gift won for us by the saving love of Jesus Christ. This is reinforced in the oft-quoted John 3:16 found in the today’s Gospel: “For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him might not perish but might have eternal life.” As God’s “handiwork,” our response to his generosity it to obediently carry out “the good works God has prepared in advance.”  What good works is God asking you to carry out this week in response to his Word?</li>

<h2>Canticle of Praise</h2>
<p><b>Canticle of Zechariah (Luke 1:68-79)</b><br>

<b>Together:</b> ✠ Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel;<br>
he has come to his people and set them free.<br>
He has raised up for us a mighty savior,<br>
born of the house of his servant David.<br>
Through his holy prophets he promised of old<br>
that he would save us from our enemies,<br>
from the hands of all who hate us.<br>
He promised to show mercy to our fathers<br>
and to remember his holy covenant.<br>
This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham:<br>
to set us free from the hands of our enemies,<br>
free to worship him without fear,<br>
holy and righteous in his sight<br>
all the days of our life.<br>
You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High;<br>
for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way,<br>
to give his people knowledge of salvation<br>
by the forgiveness of their sins.<br>
In the tender compassion of our God<br>
the dawn from on high shall break upon us,<br>
to shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death,<br>
and to guide our feet into the way of peace.<br>
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,<br>
and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,<br>
world without end. Amen.</p>
